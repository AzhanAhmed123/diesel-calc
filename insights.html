            <div class="story-card">
                <h3>The Struggle with Load Shedding</h3>
                <p>If you live in Karachi, you know the sound of a diesel generator starting up the moment the lights go out. For many, load shedding isn't just an inconvenience; it’s a daily reality that forces us to rely on expensive, noisy, and smoky generators just to keep the fans spinning and the water pumps running. But while these "big machines" solve our immediate power problem, they create a silent one: they breathe out thick carbon smoke that stays in our streets, making the city hotter and the air harder to breathe.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-card">
                <h3>It’s Not Just for Houses (or Just for Karachi)</h3>
                <p>While we focus on Karachi because of its unique energy challenges, this calculator is for everyone. Whether you are running a small shop in Saddar, a large textile factory in Kotri, or a home in a completely different country, the math of pollution is the same. Diesel is a global fuel, and $CO_2$ is a global problem. This tool helps you see that your small change—switching to solar or planting a few trees—contributes to a much larger global effort to save our planet.</p>

            <div class="story-card">
                <h3>The "Invisible" Cost of Diesel</h3>
                <p>Did you know that burning just one liter of diesel is like throwing nearly 2.7kg of invisible trash into the sky? On a global level, diesel generators produce about 100 million tonnes of $CO_2$ every year. That’s enough smoke to fill billions of balloons! Most people only see the "fuel price" at the pump, but the "environmental price" is paid in rising temperatures and more frequent heatwaves. By using solar, you aren't just saving money; you're stopping that "sky-trash" from being created.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-card">
                <h3>Nature’s Amazing Cleanup Crew</h3>
                <p>Think of trees as the world’s most efficient, free air purifiers. While a solar panel stops new pollution, a tree cleans up the old pollution. A single mature tree can "eat" about 22kg of $CO_2$ every year. If every person in a city like Karachi planted just one tree in their lifetime, we could turn our "Grey City" back into a "Green City." It’s the simplest way for common people to fight back against climate change without needing a degree in engineering.</p>

            <div class="story-card">
                <h3>Beyond Karachi: The Global Energy Gap</h3>
                <p>While load shedding is a daily hurdle in Pakistan, nearly 770 million people worldwide live without reliable access to electricity. From the crowded streets of Lagos, Nigeria, to the outskirts of Mumbai, India, millions of people rely on small-scale diesel generators as their only lifeline. Your calculator isn't just a tool for one city; it is a roadmap for any community trying to move from "noisy, expensive smoke" to "silent, free sunshine."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-card">
                <h3>The Climate "Big Picture"</h3>
                <p>The earth's temperature has already risen by about 1.1°C since the industrial revolution. While that sounds like a small number, on a global scale, it means more intense heatwaves in Karachi, rising sea levels for coastal cities, and unpredictable storms everywhere. Every liter of diesel saved by a solar panel in your backyard helps slow down this global "fever." It’s about local action having a global reaction.</p>

                <h3>Urban Forests: A Universal Solution</h3>
                <p>Cities all over the world—from New York to Karachi—are discovering that concrete makes everything hotter. This is called the "Urban Heat Island" effect. By planting trees, we aren't just offsetting $CO_2$; we are creating "Global Green Corridors." Whether it's a Neem tree in Pakistan or an Oak in Europe, the mission is the same: cooling the planet one neighborhood at a time.</p>
